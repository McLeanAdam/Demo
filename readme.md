Create an automated project board, using the kanban automated template.


You can create an board inside the, which can be later converted to an issue
or 
Assigning an issue the the project board, if automated it with appear in the corresponding todo column

branching by referencing the issue like fixes #33 (where 33 is the issue number) will move the issue through the project into the in progress column

merging the branch closes the issue and moves it into the done column
This is a progress check

I'm still changing this?
